    "DIARY_TXT_002_01": "Q/IY/1764\r\nMy superiors act with alacrity now. They have sent a missive demanding I focus my studies on the conjuring of demons. So they see my crystal as a waste of time.

    "DIARY_TXT_005_00": "IX/XD/1766\r\nDays and weeks have gone by, but despite my many attempts to cultivate more crystal, the only way I have successfully proliferated it is with the original homunculus subject.

What am I doing wrong?",
    "DIARY_TXT_006_00": "I/IY/1767\r\nAt last, I have solved it. My first homunculus subject was a child, and recently deceased.
