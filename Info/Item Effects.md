## Weapons: Status Effects

Status effects have 3 tiers: Low (\~30% chance), often (\~50% chance) and always (100% chance).

For 8/16/32 bit weapons, each level increases the chance tier, so 32bit weapons **always** afflict their status!

The swordbreaker **always** debuffs enemy STR.

All other weapons have a **low** chance, except Kazikli, which afflicts **often**.

### Curse

- Hofud ─ Low
- Kazikli ─ Often
- Blood Grinder ─ Depends on level

- Murgleis ─ Low

- Silent Calamity ─ Depends on level

### Poison

## Library Books

I added the effect sof Library books to the fextralife wiki. Exact stats and required map completion % are listed.

https://bloodstainedritualofthenight.wiki.fextralife.com/Orlok+Fahrenheit+Dracule+(O.D)

The main takeaways are:

- Effects that aren't shown in-game (attack speed, EXP etc) all increase their stat by 20%.
- The Tome Of Conquest actually incorporates 4 books, not just 3. The secret book is _Tactician's Tome_, which gives +20% EXP gain. This could be an error it might get patched out later.
